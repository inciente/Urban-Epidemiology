# Urban-Epidemiology
RUDDS (Role of Urban Design on Disease Spreading) is a project meant to develop a new deterministic method to compute the likely spreading of infectious diseases in metropolitan areas and identify how characteristics of urban design (distribution of housing, schools, hospitals and workplaces) make certain neighbourhoods more susceptible to these outbreaks.
