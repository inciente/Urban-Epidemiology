The zip file in this repository (RUDDS_Soft_R1.zip) includes all scripts necessary to process census, economic and school data to run epidemiological simulations in Guadalajara (GDL, Western Mexico). There is a comprehensive README file inside. 

The Python Jupyter Notebook "Simple city simulation.ipynb" generates random rectangular cities and performs simulations under the same method as our MATLAB simulations. This may be a good place to start if you're looking to adapt our method to your own city or if you're not using MATLAB.
