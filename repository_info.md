# Role of urban design in disease spreading

Scripts in this repository are meant to run simulations of influenza outbreaks in metropolitan areas. 

The Jupyter Notebook "simple_city_simulation.ipynb" explains the method by generating random city designs and taking user input for population size, city area and disease parameters. 

MATLAB scripts were used to obtain the results reported in our preprint "Brizuela, N. G., García-Chan, N., Pulido, H. G., & Chowell, G. (2019). Understanding the role of urban design in disease spreading. bioRxiv, 766667." along with census data from INEGI and SEP, which are included within the Demography folder.
